# "Cherche" command 

This project was realised by Alexandre FRANTZ and Richard GUERCI in 2013 at Telecom Nancy, France.  
  
The aim of this project is to create a "ls" like command to list files and directories with some custom options (detailed list option, regular expression search, image search, parallel search up to N threads, ...)
